# marauders-map
Marauders Map was developed as part of a software engineering project. Inspired by the magical map in Harry Potter (that shows the current location of anyone at Hogwarts) this app does almost the same, but on the UEA campus. It allows a user to enter their schools of interest and thus find the current location of lecturers and student guides or ambassadors in the same school.
